# PacMen-Factory

Re-live (or experience for the first time) some of the fun of the classic game Pac-Man!  This has a twist, however: there are no ghosts, no dots - just PacMen... everywhere!

## To run:

Copy or drag the index.html file to your browser.  Click the button to add PacMen figures, then hit start.  Watch the Pacs wander randomly around the page.

## Future Improvements:

At some point, I hope to figure out a way to allow for other colors of Pacs to be created.
